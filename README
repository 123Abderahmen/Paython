== Paython ==

Trying to make it easy to accept payments in Python. So far, we're Paython.

Currently - you can just import the gateway needed from gateways & auth/settle/capture (sale)/void/credit once you instantiate with the proper credentials.

== Supported Gateways ==

* Authorize.net
* Innovative Gateway Solutions (Intuit)
* First Data Global Gateway (formerly Linkpoint?)

== Install Requirements ==

pip install -r requirements.txt

== Run Tests ==

First run:

nosetests -v --with-coverage gateways/*

Then just:

nosetests -v --with-coverage

When initializing a gateway, debug will output request params, xml & response text or xml. test will use the test gateway endpoint, if there is one & will raise an error otherwise (NoTestEndpointError). 


**all gateways should have**
   ? Can we make a master class that they inherit most of these functions from & just use a dict to translate key names ?
   I think that master class should have all the generic methods that make a gateway be a gateway, and the master class should be able to generate objects using something like the factory design pattern: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factory_method_pattern or a modification of it, you'll do something like payment_method = Gateway.new_authorize_net() that way we just import one object.
   
     + __init__ (user, [pw, [debug, [test]]])
     + use_credit_card (CreditCard object)
     + billing_info (billing address, phone, email)
     + shipping_info (name, shipping address, phone, email)
     + charge_setup (static/hardcoded things like: api version, response_format, mode, ssl_options, etc)
     
     + auth
     + settle
     + capture (currently sale)
     + void (should be for auths or same day captures only)
     + credit
     
     + return_response (should translate gateway specific response into unified dictionary response)

   **"meta" classes**
     + PaymentGateway
       - Exceptions? (What kind should be raised?), just a custom exception for every payment gateway.
     + XMLGateway
        - Exceptions? (What kind should be raised?)
     + SOAPGateway
        - Exceptions? (What kind should be raised?)
     + GetGateway
        - Exceptions? (What kind should be raised?)
     + PostGateway
        - Exceptions? (What kind should be raised?)
