Trying to make it easy to accept payments in Python. So far, we're Paython.

Currently - you can just import the gateway needed from gateways & auth/settle/capture (sale)/void/credit once you instantiate with the proper credentials.

Supported Gateways:

* Authorize.net
* Innovative Gateway Solutions (Intuit)
* First Data Global Gateway (formerly Linkpoint?)
